## Production Environment

To setup on production you just config all access to your service on [ecosystem.json](https://github.com/fitraaditama7/tes/blob/dev/ecosystem.json). We use [PM2](https://pm2.io/doc/en/runtime/overview) to deploy our apps to production from you local machine and we use `PM2 Runtime` to running process manager on production

**Start application for firstime on production server**

```
$ npm run start-production

```


**Deployment to production server**

Currently this deployment process still manually from your local machine. We use **PM2** `ecosystem.json` as configuration for deployment spesific server.

To start release/deploy your code to production, we need to merge all released code to branch `prod`. The first need to do before merging code to prod branch is to created [pull request](https://github.com/fitraaditama7/tes/pulls) on github from your featured branch to branch `dev` (after that make PR from dev to prod branch), or direct to branch `prod` if its an hotfix.

After all the code has been merge to branch prod, now you can run deploy script from your local machine/laptop by running script below:

```
$ npm run deploy-production

```
